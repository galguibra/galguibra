## Introduction

&emsp; &emsp; This is where you can find some samples of original code I've written for various projects: standalone scripts, modules taken from larger packages, key functions and routines—you get the idea.
I chose these samples both to represent useful, transferrable skillsets in statistics and data science, as well as to highlight code that I felt was well-organized, well-documented, and/or demonstrated creative problem-solving.
See something you like? Looking for something you'd hoped to see, but didn't find? Consider this repository an evolving work in progress, and consider me excited for feedback! Whether you're a recruiter or just an
interested observer, I'm always open to constructive critique. That said, here's hoping you leave at least a little more intrigued than you arrived :)

## Overview

&emsp; &emsp; At the moment, my featured content includes work in both Python and Excel. The Python samples come from a research project on father-inclusive pre-natal care and parenting-readiness interventions, making use
of a variety of scientific computing libraries like numpy, pandas, and scipy, among others. Taken from a larger, in-development package meant to facilitate reproduction of the project and its analyses, I coded these samples
to help process, analyze, and visualize ordinal, Likert-scale data on parenting behaviors and self-assessment of readiness and role-adjustment in first-time v.s. multiparous parents.
