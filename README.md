## Overview

This repository holds some samples of original code I've written for various research projects: standalone scripts, modules taken from larger packages, key functions and routines—you get the idea.
I chose these samples both to represent useful, transferrable skillsets and data machinery, as well as to highlight code that I felt was well-organized, well-documented, and demonstrated creative problem-solving.
