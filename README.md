## Introduction

&emsp; &emsp; This is where you can find some samples of original code I've written for various projects: standalone scripts, modules taken from larger packages, key functions and routines—you get the idea.
I chose these samples both to represent useful, transferrable skillsets in statistics and data science, as well as to highlight code that I felt was well-organized, well-documented, and/or demonstrated creative problem-solving.
See something you like? Looking for something you'd hoped to see, but didn't find? Consider this repository an evolving work in progress, and consider me excited for feedback! Whether you're a recruiter or just an
interested observer, I'm always open to constructive critique. That said, here's hoping you leave at least a little more intrigued than you arrived :)

## Overview

&emsp; &emsp; At the moment, my featured content includes work in both Python and Excel. These samples came from a research project on father-inclusive pre-natal care and parenting-readiness interventions, making use
of a variety of scientific computing libraries like numpy, pandas, scipy, the HoloViz ecosystem, and JupyterLab. There's a mix of quantitative analyses, interactive vizualizations, data-management and querying tools, and more.
Included below are the broad strokes of each sample's purpose, as well as some additional context.

### Python

These samples were written to help process, analyze, and visualize ordinal, Likert-scale data from a series of REDCap surveys. The pre-existing data management system only made the data available in raw CSV files—each measure,
timepoint, and participant record completely unlinked—so it needed a lot of processing before I could work with it effectively. 

### Excel

As for the Excel samples, I wrote them as part of a user-friendly data dashboard for people on the project team who might not be familiar with and/or comfortable using more formal database applications. I designed the system to auto-update 
itself based on basic data inputs like participant contact information, study visit dates, survey completion, engagement status, etc., with the back-end machinery in a separate workbook to simplify the front-facing toolkit. Complete with 
recruitment/retention trackers, statistical overviews, information on recent and upcoming follow-ups, and lots of dynamic array functionalities to keep things tidy, it really helped to streamline project data management.
